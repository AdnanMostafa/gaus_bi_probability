# Files

## Binomialdistribution.py

This file contains the Binomial distribution package, with formulas for mean, variance, standard deviation and the probability density function. It also allows you to plot histograms and view the mean and standard deviation. 

## Gaussian Distribution

This file contains the Gaussian distribution package, with formulas for mean, variance, standard deviation and the probability density function. It also allows you to plot histograms and view the mean and standard deviation. 

## General Distribution
